* Open - removes deleted flag from a post
* Bump - sets the timestamp to be among the first ten posts
* Off-topic - adds the offtopic tag and creates a comment stating that the post if off topic.
* Spam - marks post as spam, suspends post author
* Not spam - unmarks post from spam, reinstates post author 
 
### Moderation guidelines

Users posting content that does not belong to the site will be notified and
required to edit their content. Users may post commercially motivated posts to
the Forum section as long as the topic aligns with the main focus of this
site. Users posting obvious spam will be immediately suspended.

### User reputation

The number next to a user's name is the sum of upvotes and accepted answers
that user has collected.

### Becoming a moderator

Active users above a certain reputation threshold are periodically promoted to
moderators. You may also explicitly ask for moderation rights or suggest good
candidates on the newsgroup. Inactive users that do not visit the site for
extended periods of time may lose their moderation rights.
